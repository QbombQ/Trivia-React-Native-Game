The proportion 12/3=1/(-2) is not true. Multiplying each side of the true proportion, -1/2=(-\nk\n\n                                                    )/5, by -5 yields, 5/2=\nk\n\n                                                    Therefore, if the system has no solution, then the value of \nk \n\n                                                    is 5/2. \n\n                                                    Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.\n\n\n\n                                                    Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.\n\n\n\n                                                    Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors."

Since the slopes are the same but the \nq-\n\n                                                    intercepts are different, the lines are distinct and parallel, and the system has zero solutions.\n\n\n\n                                                    Alternate approach: To solve the system by elimination, multiply the second equation, -3\np\n\n                                                    +6\nq\n\n                                                    =-8, by -3 , yielding 9\np\n\n                                                    -18\nq\n\n                                                    =24. Adding this equation to the first equation, -9\np\n\n                                                    +18\nq\n\n                                                    =24, gives, (-9\np\n\n                                                    +9\np\n\n                                                    )+(-18\nq\n\n                                                    +18\nq\n\n                                                    )=24+24, or 0=48, which is a contradiction.

    "Formal Answer Explanation": "The correct answer is A . A system of two linear equations in two variables, \np \n\n                                                    and \nq\n\n                                                    , has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the \npq-\n\n                                                    plane are distinct and parallel. The graphs of two lines in the \npq\n\n                                                    -plane represented by equations in the form \nAp\n\n                                                    +\nBq\n\n                                                    =\nC,\n\n                                                    where \nA,B, \n\n                                                    and \nC \n\n                                                    are constants, are parallel if the coefficients of \np \n\n                                                    and \nq \n\n                                                    in one equation are proportional to the corresponding coefficients in the other equation. The first equation in the system, 30\np\n\n                                                    -54\nq\n\n                                                    =26\nq\n\n                                                    +37, can be rewritten in the form \nAp\n\n                                                    + \nBq=C\n\n                                                    by subtracting 26\nq \n\n                                                    from both sides, yielding 30\np-\n\n                                                    80\nq\n\n                                                    =37. The second equation, \nsq\n\n                                                    =1/5-6\np\n\n                                                    , can also be rewritten. Adding 6\np\n\n                                                    to both sides yields 6\np\n\n                                                    + \nsq\n\n                                                    =1/5. Now compare the coefficients of \np\n\n                                                    and \nq\n\n                                                    for the two equations. The coefficient of \np\n\n                                                    in the second equation is 1/5 of the coefficient of \np\n\n                                                    in the first equation because 30×1/5=6. For the lines to be parallel, the coefficient of \nq \n\n                                                    in the second equation must also be 1/5 of the coefficient of \nq\n\n                                                    in the first equation. Therefore, -80×1/5=\ns\n\n                                                    , or \ns\n\n                                                    =-16. Thus, if the given system has no solution, the value of \ns \n\n                                                    is -16.\n\n                                                    Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.\n\n\n\n                                                    Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.\n\n\n\n                                                    Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors."

Subtracting \nm \n\n                                                    from both sides of the second equation gives, (\nkn\n\n                                                    )-(\nm\n\n                                                    )=(1/5+\nm\n\n                                                    )-(\nm\n\n                                                    ), or -\nm\n\n                                                    +\nkn\n\n                                                    =1/5 . The ratio of the \nm\n\n                                                    -coefficients is -1/5.

Setting the ratio of the\nm\n\n                                                    -coefficients equal to the ratio of the \nn\n\n                                                    -coefficients gives: -1/5=-\nk\n\n                                                    /25. Multiplying both sides by -25 yields (-1/5)(-25)=(-\nk\n\n                                                    /25)(-25), or \nk\n\n                                                    =5.\n\n                                                    Thus, if the system has no solution, the value of\nk\n\n                                                    is 5 .\n\n                                                    Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.\n\n\n\n                                                    Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.\n\n\n\n                                                    Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors."

    "B": "210",
    "C": "280",
    "D": "300",
    "Correct Answer": "D",
    "Formal Answer Explanation": "Choice D is correct. The number of hours Alex spent walking or skating can be calculated by dividing the distance he traveled during that activity by his speed, in miles per hour, for that activity. So, the number of hours he walked can be represented by the expression \np\n\n                                                    /7, and the number of hours he skated can be represented by the expression \nq\n\n                                                    /14. It 's given that he skated for thrice as many hours as he walked, so this can be represented by the equation \nq\n\n                                                    /14=3(\np\n\n                                                    /7), which can be rewritten as \nq\n\n                                                    =6\np\n\n                                                    . It 's also given that he walked \np\n\n                                                    miles and skated \nq\n\n                                                    miles, and that he walked and skated a total of 350 miles. This can be represented by the equation \np+q\n\n                                                    =350. Substituting 6\np\n\n                                                    for \nq\n\n                                                    in this equation yields \np\n\n                                                    +6\np\n\n                                                    =350, or 7\np\n\n                                                    =350. Solving for \np\n\n                                                    yields \np\n\n                                                    =50. Determining the number of miles he skated, \nq,\n\n                                                    can be found by substituting 50 for \np\n\n                                                    in \np+q\n\n                                                    =350, which yields 50+\nq\n\n                                                    =350. Solving for \nq \n\n                                                    yields \nq\n\n                                                    =300.\n\n\n\n                                                    Choices A,B, and C are incorrect because they don 't satisfy that Alex skated thrice as many hours as he walked. In choice A, if he skated 140 miles, then he walked 210 miles, which means he skated for 10 hours and walked for 15 hours. In choice B, if he skated 210 miles, then he walked 140 miles, which means he skated for 15 hours and walked for 20 hours. In choice C, if he skated 280 miles, then he walked 70 miles, which means he skated for 20 hours and walked for 10 hours."

The equations in the given system are written in the same form, with \np\n\n                                                    and \nq \n\n                                                    on the left-hand side and a constant on the right-hand side. The coefficient of \nq\n\n                                                    in the second equation is equal to the coefficient of \nq\n\n                                                    in the first equation multiplied by 4 .

Since the values of \nb\n\n                                                    are different, the graphs of these lines have different \ny-\n\n                                                    coordinates of the \ny-\n\n                                                    intercept and are distinct.

Therefore, the graphs of the given equations are lines that intersect at zero points in the \nxy-\n\n                                                    plane.\n\n                                                    Choice B is incorrect. The graphs of a system of two linear equations have exactly one point of intersection if the lines represented by the equations have different slopes. Since the given equations represent lines with the same slope, there is not exactly one intersection point."

An equation with one variable, \ny\n\n                                                    , has infinitely many solutions only when both sides of the equation are equal for any defined value of \ny\n\n                                                    . It 's given that 4\ny\n\n                                                    -28=\na\n\n                                                    (7-\ny\n\n                                                    ), where a is a constant.\n\n                                                    This equation can be rewritten as: 4(\ny\n\n                                                    -7)=-\na\n\n                                                    (\ny\n\n                                                    -7)\n\n                                                    If this equation has infinitely many solutions, then both sides are equal for any defined value of y.

    "Formal Answer Explanation": "Choice A is correct. This equation has no solution when there is no value of \ny \n\n                                                    that produces a true statement. Solving the given equation for \ny\n\n                                                    by dividing both sides by 3\nk\n\n                                                    +9 gives: \ny\n\n                                                    =18/(3k+9) When 3\nk\n\n                                                    +9=0, the denominator becomes undefined, and the equation has no solution. Subtracting both sides of 3\nk\n\n                                                    +9=0 by 9 gives 3\nk\n\n                                                    =-9 then dividing by -3 gives the value of \nk\n\n                                                    to be -3. Therefore when \nk\n\n                                                    =-3,  the equation (3\nk\n\n                                                    +9)\ny\n\n                                                    =18 has no solution.\n\n\n\n                                                    Choices B, C, and D are incorrect. Substituting 0, 3, or 6 for\nk\n\n                                                    in the given equation yields exactly one solution for \ny,\n\n                                                    rather than no solution. For example:\n\n                                                    If \nk\n\n                                                    =0, (0+9)\ny\n\n                                                    =18, or 9\ny\n\n                                                    =18. Dividing both sides by 9 gives \ny\n\n                                                    =2.\n\n                                                    If \nk\n\n                                                    =3, (9+9)\ny\n\n                                                    =18, or 18\ny\n\n                                                    =18. Dividing both sides by 18 gives \ny\n\n                                                    =1.\n\n                                                    If \nk\n\n                                                    =6, (18+9)\ny\n\n                                                    =18, or 27\ny\n\n                                                    =18.

    "Question": "Daniel used a device called a grain extractor to remove wheat from a silo at a constant rate. The silo contained 29,000 bushels of wheat when Daniel began using the extractor.

    "Formal Answer Explanation": "Choice D is correct. After using the extractor for 6 hours, Daniel had removed 29,000-21,782= 7,218 bushels of wheat from the silo. During the 6 -hour period, the extractor removed wheat from the silo at a constant rate of 7,218÷6=1,203 bushels per hour. Assuming the extractor continues to remove wheat at this rate, after \nt \n\n                                                    hours it will have removed 1203\nt \n\n                                                    bushels of wheat.\n\n                                                    Since the silo initially contained 29,000 bushels of wheat, the equation 29,000-1203\nt\n\n                                                    =13,361 can be used to find the number of hours, \nt\n\n                                                    , Daniel will have been using the extractor when 13,361 bushels of wheat remain. Subtracting 13,361 from both sides of this equation and adding 1203\nt\n\n                                                    to both sides gives:\n\n                                                    15,639=1203\nt\n\n\n\n                                                    Dividing both sides by 1203 yields \nt\n\n                                                    =13.

Substituting 62 for \nx \n\n                                                    in the equation \nx+y\n\n                                                    =105 yields 62+\ny\n\n                                                    =105. Subtracting 62 from both sides of this equation yields \ny\n\n                                                    =43. Therefore, the mass of magnesium in the mixture is 43 grams.\n\n\n\n                                                    Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.\n\n\n\n                                                    Choice B is incorrect.

Multiplying both sides of this equation by 3/5 yields \ny\n\n                                                    =183/35. Therefore, when \nx\n\n                                                    =-2, the corresponding value of \ny\n\n                                                    for the given equation is 183/35. Substituting -3 for \nx\n\n                                                    in the given equation yields (13/7)(-3)+5/3 \ny\n\n                                                    =5, or -39/7+5/3 \ny\n\n                                                    =35/7. Adding 39/7 to both sides of this equation yields 5/3 \ny\n\n                                                    =74/7. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 3/5 yields \ny\n\n                                                    =222/35. Therefore, when \nx\n\n                                                    =-3, the corresponding value of \ny \n\n                                                    for the given equation is 222/35. Substituting 4 for \nx \n\n                                                    in the given equation yields (13/7)(4)+5/3\ny\n\n                                                    =5, or 52/7+5/3 \ny\n\n                                                    =35/7. Subtracting 52/7 from both sides of this equation yields 5/3 \ny\n\n                                                    =-17/7. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 3/5 yields \ny\n\n                                                    =-51/35. Therefore, when \nx\n\n                                                    =4, the corresponding value of \ny\n\n                                                    for the given equation is -51/35. The table in choice D gives \nx\n\n                                                    -values of -2,-3 , and 4 and corresponding \ny-\n\n                                                    values of 183/35, 222/35, and -51/35, respectively. Therefore, the table in choice D gives three values of \nx\n\n                                                    and their corresponding values of\ny\n\n                                                    for the given equation.\n\n\n\n                                                    Choice A is incorrect.

    "Formal Answer Explanation": "The correct answer is B. A line in the \nxy\n\n                                                    -plane can be represented by the equation \ny=mx+b,\n\n                                                    where m is the slope of the line and \nb\n\n                                                    is the \ny\n\n                                                    -coordinate of the \ny-\n\n                                                    intercept.

It 's also given that line \np\n\n                                                    has an \ny-\n\n                                                    intercept of (0,27). Therefore, \nb\n\n                                                    =27. We have to find the\nx\n\n                                                    -coordinate of the \nx-\n\n                                                    intercept of line \np\n\n                                                    .

A line in the \nxy\n\n                                                    -plane can be defined by the equation \ny=mx+b\n\n                                                    , where m is the slope of the line and \nb\n\n                                                    is the \ny-\n\n                                                    coordinate of the \ny-\n\n                                                    intercept of the line. It 's given that line l passes through the point (0,0).

It 's given that line h is defined by 3/4 \nx\n\n                                                    +2/17 \ny-\n\n                                                    132+5/4 \nx\n\n                                                    =0. This equation can be written in slope intercept form \ny=mx+b, \n\n                                                    where \nm\n\n                                                    is the slope of line \nh\n\n                                                    and \nb\n\n                                                    is the \ny\n\n                                                    -coordinate of the \ny\n\n                                                    -intercept of line \nh.\n\n                                                    Solving the like terms gives 8/4 \nx\n\n                                                    +2/17 \ny\n\n                                                    -132=0. Adding 132 to both sides of 8/4 \nx\n\n                                                    +2/17 \ny\n\n                                                    -132=0 yields \n\n                                                    8/4\nx\n\n                                                    +2/17 \ny\n\n                                                    =132. Subtracting 8/4 \nx\n\n                                                    or 2\nx \n\n                                                    from both sides of this equation yields 2/17\ny\n\n                                                    =-2\nx\n\n                                                    +132. Dividing both sides by 2 yields 1/17 \ny\n\n                                                    =-\nx\n\n                                                    +66. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 17 yields\ny\n\n                                                    =-17 \nx\n\n                                                    +1,122. Therefore, the slope of line \nh \n\n                                                    is -17. It 's given that line \nj \n\n                                                    is perpendicular to line h in the\nxy\n\n                                                    -plane. Two lines are perpendicular if their slopes are negative reciprocals, meaning that the slope of the first line is equal to -1 divided by the slope of the second line. Therefore, the slope of line\nj \n\n                                                    is the negative reciprocal of the slope of line \nh.\n\n                                                    The negative reciprocal of -17 is (-1)/((-17) ), or 1/17. Therefore, the slope of line \nj \n\n                                                    is 1/17.\n\n\n\n                                                    Choice A is incorrect. This is the slope of a line in the \nxy-\n\n                                                    plane that is parallel, not perpendicular, to line \nh.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                    Choice B is incorrect. This is the reciprocal, not the negative reciprocal, of -17.\n\n\n\n                                                    Choice D is incorrect. This is the negative, not the negative reciprocal, of -17."

    "Formal Answer Explanation": "The correct answer is D. The slope of a line can be found by using the slope formula, (\ny\n\n                                                    _2-\ny_\n\n                                                    1)/(\nx_\n\n                                                    2-\nx_\n\n                                                    1 ). It 's given that the slope of the line is 5; therefore, (\ny\n\n                                                    _2-\ny\n\n                                                    _1)/(\nx\n\n                                                    _2-\nx\n\n                                                    _1 )=5.

Substituting the coordinates of these points into the equation gives (-3/2-(-13/2))/(\nk\n\n                                                    -8)=5. Multiplying both sides of this equation by \nk\n\n                                                    -8 gives 13/2-3/2=5(\nk\n\n                                                    -8), or 10/2=5\nk-\n\n                                                    40. Solving for \nk\n\n                                                    gives \nk\n\n                                                    =9.
