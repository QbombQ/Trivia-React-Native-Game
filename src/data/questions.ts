    "Question": "Liam and Emma bought books and notebooks from a stationery store. The price of each book was the same, and the price of each notebook was also the same. Liam purchased 6 books and 3 notebooks for $138, while Emma purchased 5 books and 7 notebooks for $250. Which of the following systems of linear equations represents this situation, if 𝑥 represents the price, in dollars, of each book and 𝑦 represents the price, in dollars, of each notebook?",
    "IMG URL": "",
    "Difficulty": "Easy",
    "A": "6𝑥 + 3𝑦 = 138\n\n5𝑥 + 7𝑦 = 250",
    "B": "6𝑥 + 5𝑦 = 138\n\n3𝑥 + 7𝑦 = 250",

    "Formal Answer Explanation": "Choice A is correct. Liam purchased 6 books, each costing $𝑥 dollars, for a total of 6𝑥 dollars. He also bought 3 notebooks, each costing $𝑦 dollars, for a total of 3𝑦 dollars. Thus, the total amount Liam spent can be represented by 6𝑥 + 3𝑦 = 138. Similarly, Emma purchased 5 books at $𝑥 dollars each and 7 notebooks at $𝑦 dollars each, for a total of 5𝑥 + 7𝑦 = 250."

    "Question": "A concert venue sells two types of tickets. The general ticket, for basic admission, costs $7. The VIP ticket, which includes admission and access to a backstage tour, costs $15. One Friday, the venue sold a total of 300 tickets and collected a total of $3,500 from ticket sales. Which of the following systems of equations can be used to find the number of general tickets 𝑔, and VIP tickets 𝑣, sold on that Friday?",

    "C": "7𝑔 + 15𝑣 = 300\n𝑔 + 𝑣 = 3,500",
    "D": "15𝑔 + 7𝑣 = 300\n𝑔 + 𝑣 = 3,500",
    "Correct Answer": "A",
    "Formal Answer Explanation": "Choice A is correct. It is given that the concert venue sells two types of tickets, general and VIP, and that 𝑔 represents the number of general tickets sold and 𝑣 represents the number of VIP tickets sold. It is also given that the venue sold 300 tickets on one Friday; thus, 𝑔 + 𝑣 = 300. Additionally, the cost per general ticket is $7, and the cost per VIP ticket is $15. Thus, the amount collected from ticket sales can be represented as 7𝑔 for general tickets and 15𝑣 for VIP tickets. The total revenue collected is $3,500, leading to the equation 7𝑔 + 15𝑣 = 3,500."
